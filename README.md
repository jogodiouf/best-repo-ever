## What is inside a README?

A good README explains what the project is and how to use it. It usually includes:

**Project Title & Description:** What does this code actually do?

**Installation:** How do I set this up on my own computer? (e.g., npm install).

**Usage:** Examples of how to run the code or what the commands are.

**Technologies Used:** Is it built with Python, React, or C++?

**Why is it named README in all caps?**

The tradition of using all capital letters dates back to the 1970s. In older computer systems, files were listed alphabetically, and capital letters came before lowercase letters. Naming the file README (in caps) ensured it would appear at the very top of the folder, making it impossible for a developer to miss before they started looking at the actual code.
